Wealthbot
=========

This is the django-ported of the Wealthbot.io system, originally written in
PHP/Symfony. Currently, only the client on-boarding function has been ported.
Other parts will be ported to this django project progressively.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Goto 'wealthbot' folder

2. Run 'python3 manage.py runserver' to start the development server in
   Ubuntu. If you're using Windows or macOs, run 'python' instead.

3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and try out the client on-boarding function.
